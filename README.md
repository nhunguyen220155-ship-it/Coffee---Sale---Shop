# Coffee Shop Sales Dashboard – Data-Driven Decision Making

## Project Overview
This project analyzes transactional sales data from Maven Roasters to support data-driven operational decisions. Using SQL for data extraction and Power BI for visualization, the dashboard focuses on sales performance, customer demand patterns, and product contribution. The primary decision-makers are coffee shop managers and operations teams who need insights for staffing, promotions, and product focus.

## Dataset
- Source: Maven Roasters Coffee Shop Sales Dataset
- Type: Transaction-level sales data
- Key fields: transaction date, product category, quantity sold, unit price, store location

## Business Problem
The project addresses the challenge of understanding when demand occurs, which products drive revenue, and whether sales trends indicate operational or demand-related issues.
The goal is to identify actionable insights that improve efficiency without increasing costs.

## Key KPIs
- Total Sales
- Total Orders
- Total Quantity Sold
- Sales trends by day, hour, product category, and store location

## Key Insights
- Sales show a moderate month-over-month decline (~5–7%) across all major KPIs, indicating a demand-side slowdown rather than operational issues.
- Weekdays generate approximately 70% of total sales, reflecting routine-driven customer behavior.
- Peak demand consistently occurs during 8–11 AM and 4–6 PM across all store locations.
- Core beverages (Coffee, Espresso, Brewed Coffee) contribute the majority of revenue, while retail-style products have minimal impact.

## Evidence-Based Decision
Based on hourly sales patterns, the data supports aligning staffing levels and operational focus with peak demand hours (8–11 AM and 4–6 PM). 
This decision can improve service efficiency and customer experience without increasing labor costs.

## Tools Used
- SQL (data querying and KPI calculation)
- Power BI (dashboard visualization and interactivity)

## Limitations
- The dataset does not include cost, profit, or customer-level data, limiting analysis to revenue and volume metrics.
- The short time range restricts long-term trend and forecasting analysis.
- KPI analysis is descriptive in some areas due to limited contextual business variables.
